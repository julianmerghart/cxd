Next Step for Deployment

To make this app accessible to citizens:

Host it: You can host this React app on Vercel or Netlify for free (high availability CDN).

Point it: Update the fetch() URL in the handleVote function to point to your Azure Container Instance IP address.

This gives you a complete loop: Citizen (App) -> Cloud (C Server) -> Ledger (Disk).
