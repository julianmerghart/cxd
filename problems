The Digital Constitution of CxD

Imagine a world without politcians!

CxD is designed to be used alongside AI and the most powerful AI processing.  To maintain fairness and accuracy, there is a huge amount of AI and cloud infrastructure that is required.

No human being should be in control of the system.  It is not designed for that purpose.

The CxD system is designed for any region on Planet Earth where human beings have no government or live under a forced dictatorship.

Preamble:

This repository holds the consensus logic for the interim governance of Sri Lanka. Access to modify this code is a public trust, not a private right. To prevent the concentration of power and the rise of digital authoritarianism, all contributors and maintainers agree to the following immutable rules.

Article I: The Separation of Powers

Section 1. The Repository (The Executive)

The "Maintainers" (Tech Team) have the right to merge code related to performance, UI, and security.

The Maintainers DO NOT have the right to merge code that modifies:

PROPOSALS (Ballot Measures)

DICTIONARY (Language/Meaning)

UBI_LOGIC (Financial Distribution)

Section 2. The Consensus (The Legislative)

Changes to the files listed above require a Quorum Merge.

A Quorum Merge requires digital approval (Review Sign-offs) from at least 3 distinct, verified Council Members.

No single individual, regardless of rank, may push directly to the main branch.

Article II: The Right to Fork

The code must always remain Open Source (MIT License).

If the Maintainers act against the public interest, the "Canonical" status of this repository is automatically revoked.

The community has the moral and technical right to "Fork" (copy) this system and migrate their Identity/UBI keys to the new instance.

Article III: The Canary Clause (Anti-Coup Mechanism)

The Dead Man's Switch: If the repository does not receive a "Heartbeat" commit verifying democratic integrity every 30 days, the system enters "Read-Only Mode" automatically.

This prevents a captured government from secretly running the system indefinitely without public scrutiny.

Ratified by the Interim Technocratic Council, 2025.v
